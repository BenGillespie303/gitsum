	<h1>Dearest Git,</h1>
	<p>The past few days with you have been pretty okay. I am, however, concerned about your relationship with your nephew, GitHub. You are always pushing him in ways I do not understand.</p>
	<p>I ask you to commit, and you demand a reason why. You then reply, "On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.". What the fuck does that even mean?</p>

	Git Sum 
	Git lost
	Git out
	Git paid 
	Git dunked on
	<p>how to edit pictures with bash</p>

	<h1>Dearest Git,</h1>
	<p>The past few days with you have been pretty okay. I am, however, concerned about your relationship with your son, GitHub. You are always pushing him in ways I do not understand.</p>
	<p>I ask you to commit, and you demand a reason why. You then reply, "On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.". What the fuck does that even mean? Sometimes I wonder if you want me to git lost, but when I ask you don't say a word. The same is true for git out, git paid, and git dunked on! Communication is not your strong point.</p>
	<p></p>
	

	<!-- To Git:
	Git Sum 
	Git lost

	To GitHub:

	<h1>Dearest Bash,</h1>
	<p>I know you are way older than me and all my previous partners, but I won't let that stop our passionate love affair. I know you have a working relationship with my other lovers, Git and GitHub, but I won't let that hinder our relationship.</p>
	<p>I think of you as a retro lover. I love the way you nano my stuff. The way you cd, ls, mkdir, and pwd is no match for the way you touch me.</p>
	<p>I could watch your ASCI Star wars for days, and all I would have to do is type: telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl into the command line.</p>
